      <p className="text-white">
        An innovative <span className="font-extrabold">Augmented Reality</span> game that lets users experience cat ownershipâ€”minus the litter box or allergy worries. Players can adopt and interact with virtual cats, each with unique personalities and behaviors, brought to life in their real environment through AR. Users engage in activities like feeding, bathing, and playing to build a bond with their pet. The cats respond adaptively to care and attention, promoting a sense of responsibility. Mini-games and achievements add extra fun and make the experience both meaningful and rewarding.
